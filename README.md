# SimpleSplitView
SimpleSplitView is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: A very simple jQuery plugin that provides an iPad-style split view for mobile devices wide enough to support it. For browsers with a horizontal resolution of 700 or fewer pixels, the plugin renders the two sides as subsequent pages. It works great in conjunction with jQuery Mobile, although it is not technically required.

Unlike other split view implementations for jQuery Mobile, SimpleSplitView does not fork the jQuery Mobile project.
